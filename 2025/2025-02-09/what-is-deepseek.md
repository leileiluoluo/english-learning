We're starting today with a new artificial intelligence model that's disrupting the technology industry.

A powerful and efficent AI model developed by a Chinese startup company called DeepSeek is proving it can nearly match the capabilities of its more famous US rivals like OpenAI's GTP4, Meta's Llama and Google's Gemini.

And it's doing it all at a fraction of the cost.

The company says it's spent just 5.6 million dollars powering its base AI model called R1 while its US rivals spent hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars on powering their AI technologies.

What's also raising eyebrows is that the US has restricted the supply of supercharged computer chips that power AI to China meaning DeepSeek has supposedly able to achieve this at a low cost model on less capable AI chips.

AI is a power hungry cost intensive technology.

Last year, Sam Alman, the CEO of OpenAI said the industry would need trillions of dollars from investors to develop the in demand chips needed to power the data centers that run the complex AI models.

R1's release is now changing the industry's understanding of how much investment is needed in AI.

The DeepSeek has surged on the AppStore charts surpassing ChatGPT with millions of downloads and it shook up Wall Street sending stocks for the leading supplier of AI chips and other tech companies plunging earlier in the week.

"A blockbuster reveal showing that China could be closing the gap with the US in the development of artificial ingelligence. A Chinese startup company called DeepSeek has shown off a striking new development, an AI program called R1, which DeepSeek says has very similar capabilities to ChatGPT the AI model developed by the American tech giant OpenAI."

Professor Jeffrey says on key barometer to watch for in DeepSeek R1's future is what it's used most for. Whether it's used primarily as an office assistant and productivity type tool or possibly for other things like maybe a source of news in which case he says it could encounter a lot more resistance from entities like the US government.
